1. Because it was done as a float. Floats are less precise for decimals than Doubles
which causes the numbers to be altered.

2. When doing calculation with variables that have decimals we have to clarify
what kind of variable we are using for it not to give
error. So we have to either implicity advise the computer that
we are dealing with doubles (like in the example adding a .0 at the end of the number)
or explicitly adding (double) before either the number or variable.

3. a)the value of the variable result is 72 as its being cast as an int and ints dont allow decimals
   b)values are: 1/0.00 2/72 3/0.00 4/72
   c)we arge casting in both the cases an integrel as floats or doubles which are not.
   we should first promote them either explicitly or implicitly and then cast them.
