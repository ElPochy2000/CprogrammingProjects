1. I had to learn how to nest different kind of loops
and how to play with the "&&" and the "||". The problem of doing it
is that i had to make the code look organized and easy to read so if there
were any errors it would be easy to track and solve.
So what i did is that divided the loops in groups and i commented
the file so either me or any other person reading my code could understand.

2. Without nesting I guess that i would have done a big For loop
where if the condition or if statment is not met i would do "i=-1"
so the for loop by itself wouldnt come to a conclusion until
the condition is truth.

3. With a series of ifs it would look deorganized and hard to read for
another person trying to look at your code.
But, if we use if/else if we can know that the rest of the conditions are 
connected with each other.
