1. The for itineration as we have to explore the array for us to look for an specific content
inside the array. Also generally we don't want it to break until it finalizes running the whole
array and the While and do while would break as soon as it gets the desire result.

2. The most common ways that i found out the syntax problems were generally located
by visual studio code itself and they were marked in red both in the code itself and the
right bar for navigating it. I could only figure out semantic errors when running the code 
either by warnings or undesired results. The most common ones that i found where the pointer error
for characters and calculations errors due to me trying to summon doubles as int or the other way
arround.

3. The system is expecting an imput which i did not put. Next time i should imput the desired imput.
