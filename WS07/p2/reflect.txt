1. I think i could have done the non-repetitive pieces of the code better however i did not have enought 
time to finish it. I played a lot with loops to get the result decired and according to this 
loops reacted to either the user input or game features like the path input. This way the loops are "moldable".


2. I don't think the structures simplified this program in particular but i do understand the use of it.
If i had to create multiple users or multiple "gamemodes" i would use the struct as a model for the variables inside instead
of having to take the time to create a variable for each user.

3. while (Condition) {
  while (condition) {
    if (condition) {

    } else if (condition) {

    }
  }
}
I used an loop similar to this to be able to give an appropiate response according to the user
input.
